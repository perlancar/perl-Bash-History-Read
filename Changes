Revision history for Bash-History-Read

0.03    2015-11-05 (PERLANCAR)

        - Change parsing algorithm to be more flexible and more closely follows
          bash. Since bash history file can contain a mix of entries that have
          timestamps and entries that do not, we just need to assume that all
          /^\#\d+$/ lines are timestamps, instead of requiring that all entries
          are prefixed with a timestamp.

        - Add parse_bash_history_file().


0.02    2015-11-04 (PERLANCAR)

	- [Bugfix] Don't add timestamp for each line in a multiple-line
	  entry.


0.01    2015-10-12 (PERLANCAR)

        - First release.
